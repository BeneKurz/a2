TODO: roadmap
    * make add-ctrl a Menu button that expands accordingly
        * include >
            blabla.ahk
            xyzabc123.ahk
            create new
        * hotkey
        * checkbox
    * implement include
	* implement checkbox
		* to toggle include of an ahk-file
		* to toggle variable
	* include groupbox ... idea WIP: groupbox object is drawn as usual via control list but when asked for config it self collects the configs of its children and passes them to submit function ...

DONE:
    * module config.json is now a list. First element is always nfo object
    * config parser now MUCH simpler. casts config elements to mapper function in
        a2ctrl in edit or draw mode which then return the according ui elements
    * ui objects now combined QtWidgets that have a2 functionality as well


a2 runtime:
    a2 starter:
        * uses autohotkey.exe from installer or local a2 bundled autohotkey.exe (optional on a2 install)
        * runs the a2.ahk through this autohotkey.exe
    a2.ahk:
        * runs includes (in that order)
            * variables (non ui ones)
            * libs (a2 libs that might be optional and used by multiple mods)
            * includes (actual scripts from enabled modules)
            * hotkeys (that refer to the included functionality)
            * init (to prepare the runtime, set up timers ect)

a2ui:
    * reads a2db for enabled modules
    * list enabled modules
    * list available modules
    * click to show module:
        * read module config file
        * build ui controls
            * set control values
                * from db if available
                * from default if not
    * change a control value:
        * check for hotkey collisions
            * with windows built-in hotkeys
            * with set up a2 hotkeys
            * report about contexts
        * write value to db
        * manage implications
            * write to hotkey list
                * file under appropriate context
            * write to include list
            * write to lib list
            * write to variable list
                * TODO: figure out runtime variable change
            * write to init list
        * call to rewrite includes
            * hotkeys:
                * gather global ones
                * collect class, exe, title specific ones
        * call a2 restart
    * enable a module
        * mod: browse through config
        * mod: collect 'include' types in config
        * mod: collect has 'include' key filled in config
                * and bool value in config
                * and is "true" in db
        * a2: collect all enabled modes includes in db
        * a2: write include.ahk
